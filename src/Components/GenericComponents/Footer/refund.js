            <p>Attempting to initiate a chargeback or dispute with your credit card company or payment provider is a violation of this Refund Policy. We reserve the right to take legal action against any individual or entity that attempts to circumvent this policy.</p>

            <h2 style={{ color: '#0073e6' }}>4. Payment Information</h2>
